Orthomesh -- Orthogonal Delaunay Mesh Generator
-----------------------------------------------

Orthomesh is a 2D Mesh Generator that creates quad-tree based meshes that can
be independently refined in X- and Y-direction. Therefore the generated meshes
can contains flat segments. This is for example useful for simulating
transistor gates in TCAD applications, that require high resolutions toward the
gate insulator but only low resolution parallel to it.

The mesher can be used from the command line using a simple text-based input
format, but is most powerful when used via its C++ API.

An extension of the basic principle to 3D is possible and under consideration
by the author. It is mainly a question of time..
